    "In this section, calcium fluxes in a compartmentalized cell were modelled. Calcium can be present in the cytosol ($Ca_{cyt}$), bound to calcium binding proteins residing in the cytosol ($CaPr$), the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) ($Ca_{ER}$) as well as the mitochondria ($Ca_m$). Fluxes between these compartments occur, leading to a an exchange of calcium. The overall setup of the system is shown in Figure X.\n",

    "$J_{pump}$ is the outflux from the cytosol into the ER via ion pumps. It depends on the rate of the ion pump (k_{pump}) as well as the current concentration of cytosolic calcium. Higher calcium concentration, as well as a more active pump lead to a higher $J_{pump}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$J_{ch}$ defines the flux from the ER into the cystosol via calcium channels. $k_{ch}\\frac{Ca_{cyt}^2}{K_1^2+Ca_{cyt}^2}$ is a modified Michealis-Menten term taking into account the max rate of the calcium channel ($k_{ch}), the affinity of the channel for calcium ($K_1$) and the current calcium concentration in the cytosol. The direction of the flux, as well as the extend is further modified by the difference in $Ca_{ER}$ and $Ca_{cyt}$. Since transport through the channels is passive, it will seak to establish equilibrium, by producing a flux from the compartment with the higher concentration to the one with the lower one. A bigger gradient between the two of them \n",
